🦜 *"What’s reality? I don’t know. When my bird was looking at my computer monitor I thought,*  
*‘That bird has no idea what he’s looking at.’ And yet what does the bird do?*  
*Does he panic? No, he can’t really panic, he just does the best he can.*  
*Is he able to live in a world where he’s so ignorant? Huum... Well, he doesn’t really have a choice.*  
*The bird is okay even though he doesn’t understand the world.*  
*You’re that bird looking at the monitor, and you’re thinking to yourself,*  
*‘I can figure this out.’ Maybe you have some bird ideas.*  
*Maybe that’s the best you can do.”* 🖥️
